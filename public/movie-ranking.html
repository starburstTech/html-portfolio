<h1>The Best Movies According to Iftekher Ali</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>Myself Allen Swapan</h3>
<p>
    I recently had the pleasure of watching the TV series "Myself Allen Swapon" and I have to say, I absolutely loved it! The show had me hooked from the very first episode and I couldn't stop watching until I had seen every single one.

<h3>The Super Mario Bros.</h3>
<p>
    I will be frank with you: “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is a good movie. It capitalized on the Nintendo nostalgia that I grew up with for years and my love for Mario. The voice acting is superb, the references are numerous and the movie is captivating. It has every right to be an international blockbuster, and there is a 90% chance that I will see it again in IMAX. There is absolutely no way for me to overlook the childlike biases I had going into this movie last night, so the review ends here — 10/10 would watch Bowser go full Elton John on the keyboard again

<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3</h3>
<p>
    I loved it. Cool sci-fi movie.
